# ReactOnboarding Form

This is a simple project which the main idea behind it was to use some advanced concepts from _React API_, such as _Container Components_, _React Clone_ and manipulation of _React elements_, to develop a form that behaves like it has multiple screens, but, actually, has only one.

To run, you only need to:

- Clone the project;
- Run `yarn install` or `npm install`

The style was made using Tailwind CSS.
